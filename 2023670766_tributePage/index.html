          A staunch advocate for poverty eradication, Ungku Aziz introduced innovative concepts such as the "Sarong Index," a metric assessing rural poverty based on the ratio of sarongs to household members. He also proposed the "Theory of Neglect," identifying factors like low productivity and institutional discrimination as root causes of poverty. His insights significantly influenced Malaysia's rural development policies.
